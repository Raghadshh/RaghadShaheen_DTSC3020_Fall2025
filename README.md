# Introduction to Computation with Python (DTSC 3020)

This repository contains my Python programming labs, in-class exercises, and assignments for **DTSC 3020 – Introduction to Computation with Python** at the **University of North Texas** (Fall 2025).  
All work was completed in **Google Colab** and uploaded to GitHub as part of the course requirements.

## Course Overview

This course introduces fundamental programming and data analysis skills using Python.  
Each assignment focuses on building strong computational thinking, problem-solving, and logical reasoning abilities for data science applications.

---

## Topics Covered

- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops and iteration (`for`, `while`)
- Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
- Functions and modular programming
- Exception handling
- File input/output
- Object-oriented programming (classes and objects)
- Basic algorithm design and recursion

---

## Assignment Highlights

### Conditional Logic
Developed multiple mini-programs to:
- Categorize users by age group (child, teen, adult)
- Apply discounts and compute totals for an online store
- Simulate grading, parking fees, and loan eligibility
- Provide clothing suggestions and guest list validation

### Dictionaries and Data Mapping
Practiced operations with Python dictionaries:
- Found students with the lowest grades  
- Filtered by course titles containing "Data"  
- Calculated class averages and book availability in a library system

### Midterm – Applied Programming
Implemented:
- A **Library Member ID generator** (string manipulation and loops)  
- A **Movie Ticket Booth** (loops, conditionals, and tax calculation)  
- A **Grade Analyzer** (functions with multiple returns)  
- A **PIN Verification System** (while loops and input validation)

### Inventory Item Class
Designed an `InventoryItem` class to manage:
- Product details (`name`, `price`, `quantity`, `min_stock`)
- Inventory operations: `restock()`, `sell()`, and `value()`
- Error handling for invalid or negative inputs
